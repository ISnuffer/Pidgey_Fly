Welcome to Fly Pidgey, Fly!

This is a basic clone of Flappy Bird created for educational purposes only.  This was created using Python and gives examples of the following:

Using a database to store longterm data
printing an image to a screen
a main game loop
refreshing the game screen
detecting collision
score count
Among others

You'll be presented with two buttons upon starting main.py: Start Game and Top Scores

Start game will open an instance of the gameWindow
  In game, hold 'a', space, or enter to fly.  Let go to fall.

Top Scores will query the sqlite database file to pull our top scores.
